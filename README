# TrigDVHypo: displaced-vertex dedicated HLT trigger package 
#             integrated within the Athena framework (ATLAS 
#             software).
#             The code mainly contains a FEX (feature extraction 
#             algorithm), a Hypo (Hypothesis algorithm) and the
#             configuration python files needed to properly load
#             the trigger chain.
#
#             The trigger decision is obtained by reconstructing
#             the tracks seeded by each RoI (not Full-Scan) and 
#             cutting in the properties that defines a displaced
#             vertex track (high-d0, max number of Silicon hits,...)
