# TODO
 * Monitoring Fex:
   - Check how to store/declare an TH2F histogram and their associated variables
     The approach used now (std::vector) doesn't work (for XY SV positions)
   - Should I incorporate more monitoring variables?
     - Number of PV
     - PV position
     - Jet energy
     - Track related variables (up to now tracks is not used)
     - RoI related ?
   - Decide which variables goes to Validation and which ones to Online targets.
 * Fex:
   - Decided if tracks play a role (so far they're not used)
   - Clean
   - Check the returned values, warnings and errors
   - Optimization of SV: 
         * Is it ok the current sequence of algorithms (see generateDvChainDefs)?
         * is there room to change some values in the algorithmm in charge of 
         creating the tracks which are going to be used to find SV? Investigating
         which algorithm is that. Identified the sequence (therVertex_tracks, so
         it should be one of the algorithms of the chain: 
https://svnweb.cern.ch/trac/atlasoff/browser/InnerDetector/InDetExample/InDetTrigRecExample/tags/InDetTrigRecExample-00-11-29/python/EFInDetConfig.py
         * OR I think I localized the cuts in the theVxSecondary, at least combined with 
         the ones above, for instance change the CutBLayHits from 1 to 0, CutSiHits from 7 to 4?,... 
         (InDetTrigVxSecondary.InDetTrigVxSecondary_LoadTools package)
 * Hypo
   - Should I investigate other cutting variables? d0, ..
